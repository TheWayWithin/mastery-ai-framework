## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the MASTERY-AI Framework seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow our responsible disclosure process.

### How to Report

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/TheWayWithin/mastery-ai-framework/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the security advisory form

2. **Direct Contact**
   - Email: security@mastery-ai-framework.org (when available)
   - Subject: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"

3. **Encrypted Communication**
   - For highly sensitive reports, request our PGP key
   - Encrypted reports ensure confidentiality during investigation

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

**Vulnerability Details:**
- Type of vulnerability (injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
- Framework component affected (core, API, pillar-specific, etc.)
- Attack vector and exploitation method
- Potential impact assessment
- Affected versions

**Reproduction Information:**
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Minimal test case or proof of concept

- Assessment input data that triggers the vulnerability

**Assessment Context:**
- Which pillar(s) or factor(s) are affected
- Impact on assessment accuracy or security
- Data exposure risks
- Potential for malicious manipulation of scores

## Response Process

### Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to this timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage and Assessment**: Within 5 business days  
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity (see below)
- **Release and Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Impact | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach | 24 hours | 1-3 days |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, authentication bypass | 48 hours | 3-7 days |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | 5 days | 1-2 weeks |
| **Low** | Minor information leakage | 1 week | Next release |

### Framework-Specific Severity Factors

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- Assessment manipulation affecting all 148 factors
- Arbitrary code execution through assessment input
- Complete bypass of framework validation
- Mass data exfiltration from assessment results

**High Vulnerabilities:**
- Manipulation of pillar weights or scoring logic
- Authentication bypass in API endpoints
- Injection attacks through content analysis
- Privilege escalation in multi-tenant deployments

**Medium Vulnerabilities:**
- Information disclosure of assessment methodology
- Partial bypass of input validation
- DoS attacks on assessment engine
- Insecure default configurations

**Low Vulnerabilities:**
- Minor information leakage in logs
- Non-exploitable edge cases
- Informational security improvements

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

**Input Validation:**
- Comprehensive validation of assessment input data
- Sanitization of user-provided content
- Schema validation for API requests
- Rate limiting on assessment endpoints

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- API key-based authentication (where applicable)
- Role-based access control for different operations
- Secure session management
- Configurable access controls

**Data Protection:**
- No data retention by default
- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS required)
- Secure handling of sensitive assessment data
- Anonymization options for assessment results

**Infrastructure Security:**
- Secure defaults in configuration
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Audit logging for security events
- Regular security dependency updates

### Framework Integrity

**Assessment Security:**
- Validation of framework mathematical consistency
- Protection against scoring manipulation
- Secure handling of proprietary assessment factors
- Integrity checks for framework components

**API Security:**
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Protection against injection attacks
- Secure error handling (no information leakage)
- Request/response logging for audit trails

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Deployment Security:**
```python
# Use secure configuration
from mastery_ai import Config, AssessmentEngine

config = Config()
config.security.require_https = True
config.security.api_key_required = True
config.logging.audit_enabled = True
config.data.retention_disabled = True

engine = AssessmentEngine(config)
```

**API Security:**
```python
# Secure API usage
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

# Validate and sanitize input
assessment_data = validate_input(raw_data)
response = requests.post(
    'https://your-api.com/assess',
    headers=headers,
    json=assessment_data,
    verify=True  # Verify SSL certificates
)
```

### For Developers

**Secure Coding:**
- Validate all inputs at API boundaries
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular security testing and code reviews

**Dependency Management:**
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Regular security scanning of dependencies
- Use dependency pinning for production deployments
- Monitor for security advisories
