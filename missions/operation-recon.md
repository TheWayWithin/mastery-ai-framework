# Operation: RECON 🔍
## UI/UX Reconnaissance Mission

**Mission Code**: RECON  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-4 hours  
**Complexity**: High  
**Squad Required**: Designer (lead), Tester (support)

## ORIENTATION PROTOCOL — MAP FIRST, READ NARROWLY

Orientation is the expensive step, not the edit. On a large repo the bottleneck is finding what to change, not changing it, and the tokens spent reading files that turned out to be irrelevant are the largest avoidable cost in a session. These four rules are requirements, not preferences.

1. **Glob/Grep to locate before you Read.** Find the path and the line number first: `Glob` for file paths, `Grep` for symbols, strings and call sites. Do not open a file to discover what is in it.
2. **Read only the lines you need.** Use `offset` and `limit` on Read. A 40-line window around a confirmed match beats a 900-line whole-file read.
3. **Never read a whole file to find one symbol.** Grep for the symbol, then read its neighbourhood. Read a file end to end only when you are about to change it end to end.
4. **Do not re-read what you have already read.** Every re-read re-pays the whole file as input tokens and crowds out the context you still need.

If you read a whole file, be able to state why a narrower read would not have worked.

## Mission Briefing

Execute a comprehensive UI/UX reconnaissance operation on frontend changes. This mission deploys the RECON Protocol to assess design quality, user experience, accessibility compliance, and visual consistency across all modified components.

## Required Inputs

1. **Target Scope** (required) - PR number, branch name, or specific components
2. **Live Environment** (required) - URL for testing or local dev server
3. **Design Standards** (optional) - Reference to design system or brand guidelines
4. **Success Metrics** (optional) - Specific KPIs or requirements to validate

## Mission Phases

### Phase 0: Intelligence Gathering (15 minutes)

**Lead**: @coordinator  
**Support**: @designer  
**Objective**: Understand scope and prepare battlefield

```bash
# Assess the operational theater
git fetch origin
git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat
git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only | grep -E '\.(jsx?|tsx?|css|scss|sass)$'

# Review mission parameters
@designer Analyze the scope:
1. Identify all UI components modified
2. Map user journeys affected
3. Review existing design patterns
4. Note any accessibility requirements
5. Check for design system compliance needs
```

**Deliverables**:
- Component inventory
- Affected user flows
- Risk assessment
- Testing priorities

### Phase 1: RECON Protocol Activation (30-45 minutes)

**Lead**: @designer  
**Support**: @tester  
**Objective**: Execute systematic UI/UX assessment

```bash
@designer Execute RECON Protocol:
1. PREPARATION - Set up Playwright, configure viewports
2. INTERACTION RECONNAISSANCE - Test all interactive elements
3. RESPONSIVE OPERATIONS - Validate across devices
4. VISUAL INSPECTION - Check consistency and aesthetics
5. ACCESSIBILITY SWEEP - WCAG AA+ compliance
6. ROBUSTNESS TESTING - Edge cases and stress tests
7. CODE INSPECTION - Design token usage
8. CONSOLE RECONNAISSANCE - Check for errors
```

**Key Activities**:
- Capture screenshot evidence at each viewport
- Document all interactive state changes
- Test keyboard navigation completely
- Verify focus management
- Check color contrast ratios
- Validate responsive breakpoints

### Phase 2: SENTINEL Mode Deployment (30-45 minutes)

**Lead**: @tester  
**Support**: @designer  
**Objective**: Comprehensive functional and visual validation

```bash
@tester Activate SENTINEL Mode:
1. PERIMETER ESTABLISHMENT - Map test coverage
2. FUNCTIONAL RECONNAISSANCE - Test all features
3. VISUAL REGRESSION SWEEP - Compare against baseline
4. CROSS-BROWSER OPERATIONS - Multi-browser testing
5. PERFORMANCE PATROL - Load time analysis
6. STRESS TESTING - Break it creatively
7. ACCESSIBILITY VERIFICATION - Deep validation
```

**Testing Matrix**:
- Chrome/Chromium (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari/WebKit (if applicable)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome)
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Threat Assessment (20 minutes)

**Lead**: @designer  
**Support**: @tester  
**Objective**: Classify and prioritize findings

```bash
@designer Classify all findings:
[CRITICAL] - Blocks user progress, breaks accessibility
[URGENT] - Major UX degradation, needs immediate fix
[TACTICAL] - Medium priority improvements
[COSMETIC] - Minor polish items

@tester Add functional severity:
[CRITICAL] - System failure or data loss
[HIGH] - Major functionality broken
[MEDIUM] - Degraded experience
[LOW] - Edge cases only
```

**Classification Criteria**:
- User impact severity
- Frequency of occurrence
- Business criticality
- Technical complexity to fix
- Regression risk

### Phase 4: Evidence Collection (15 minutes)

**Lead**: @designer  
**Support**: @tester  
**Objective**: Document all findings with proof

```bash
@designer Capture evidence:
1. Screenshot all issues at point of failure
2. Record interaction videos for complex issues
3. Export browser console logs
4. Document exact reproduction steps
5. Note browser/device combinations affected
```

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Before/after comparisons
- Annotated screenshots
- Console error logs
- Network timing data
- Accessibility audit results

### Phase 5: Report Compilation (30 minutes)

**Lead**: @coordinator  
**Support**: @designer, @tester  
**Objective**: Deliver actionable intelligence

```bash
@coordinator Compile unified report:
1. Merge RECON and SENTINEL findings
2. Deduplicate overlapping issues
3. Prioritize by business impact
4. Create executive summary
5. Generate fix recommendations
```

**Report Sections**:
1. **Executive Summary** - Overall health, critical issues
2. **RECON Findings** - Design and UX issues
3. **SENTINEL Findings** - Functional and performance issues
4. **Evidence Gallery** - Screenshots and recordings
5. **Recommendations** - Prioritized action plan
6. **Metrics** - Coverage, pass/fail rates

## Post-Mission Cleanup Decision

After completing this mission, decide on cleanup approach based on project status:

### ✅ Milestone Transition (Every 2-4 weeks)
**When**: This mission completes a major project milestone, but more work remains.

**Actions** (30-60 min):
1. Extract lessons to `lessons/[category]/` from progress.md
2. Archive milestone-relevant Phase Handoff blocks from agent-context.md if needed
3. Clean agent-context.md (retain essentials, archive historical details)
4. Continue using agent-context.md (Phase Handoff blocks accumulate across milestones)
5. Update project-plan.md with next milestone tasks

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section A for detailed steps

### 🎯 Project Completion (Mission accomplished!)
**When**: All project objectives achieved, ready for new mission.

**Actions** (1-2 hours):
1. Extract ALL lessons from entire progress.md to `lessons/`
2. Create mission archive in `archives/missions/mission-[name]-YYYY-MM-DD/`
3. Update CLAUDE.md with system-level learnings
4. Archive all tracking files (project-plan.md, progress.md, etc.)
5. Prepare fresh start for next mission

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section B for detailed steps

### 🔄 Continue Active Work (No cleanup needed)
**When**: Mission complete but continuing active development in same phase.

**Actions**: Update progress.md and project-plan.md, continue working.
