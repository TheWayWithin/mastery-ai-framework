# AGENT-11 Mission Library 🎯

## Available Missions

This library contains standardized mission protocols for common development scenarios. Each mission provides a proven execution pattern for multi-agent collaboration.

**Profile Switching (RETIRED in v6.0)**: Tools now defer-load and are discovered via Tool Search at runtime. No profile switching is needed — `tool_search_tool_regex_20251119(pattern="mcp__SERVERNAME")` loads what's required on demand.

## Mission Execution Guide

### Starting a Mission

```bash
# Interactive mode - guided mission selection
/coord

# Direct mission with inputs
/coord [mission-name] [input-files...]
```

### Mission Phases

All missions follow a standard phase structure:

1. **Intelligence Gathering** - Understanding requirements
2. **Strategic Planning** - Architecture and approach
3. **Execution** - Implementation by specialists
4. **Validation** - Testing and quality assurance
5. **Deployment** - Production readiness

### Success Criteria

Each mission includes:
- Clear objectives
- Required inputs
- Phase breakdown with time estimates
- Specialist assignments
- Success metrics
- Common variations

## Creating Custom Missions

To create a new mission:

1. Copy `templates/mission-template.md`
2. Define clear phases and specialist roles
3. Add to this library index
4. Test with coordinator

## Mission Best Practices

- Always start with clear requirements
- Let specialists own their domains
- Track progress in project-plan.md
- Document learnings in progress.md
- Iterate based on outcomes

## Post-Mission Cleanup Decision

After completing this mission, decide on cleanup approach based on project status:

### ✅ Milestone Transition (Every 2-4 weeks)
**When**: This mission completes a major project milestone, but more work remains.

**Actions** (30-60 min):
1. Extract lessons to `lessons/[category]/` from progress.md
2. Archive milestone-relevant Phase Handoff blocks from agent-context.md if needed
3. Clean agent-context.md (retain essentials, archive historical details)
4. Continue using agent-context.md (Phase Handoff blocks accumulate across milestones)
5. Update project-plan.md with next milestone tasks

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section A for detailed steps

### 🎯 Project Completion (Mission accomplished!)
**When**: All project objectives achieved, ready for new mission.

**Actions** (1-2 hours):
1. Extract ALL lessons from entire progress.md to `lessons/`
2. Create mission archive in `archives/missions/mission-[name]-YYYY-MM-DD/`
3. Update CLAUDE.md with system-level learnings
4. Archive all tracking files (project-plan.md, progress.md, etc.)
5. Prepare fresh start for next mission

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section B for detailed steps

### 🔄 Continue Active Work (No cleanup needed)
**When**: Mission complete but continuing active development in same phase.

**Actions**: Update progress.md and project-plan.md, continue working.
