**Framework Factors**
If this feature involves assessment factors:

- **New Factors**: Would this add new atomic factors to the 148 total?
- **Factor Modifications**: Would this modify existing factors?
- **Weight Impact**: How would this affect pillar weights (must total 100%)?
- **Scoring Impact**: How would this affect the overall scoring methodology?

**Mathematical Considerations**
For features affecting scoring or assessment:

- Maintain mathematical precision in calculations
- Preserve backward compatibility where possible

{
  "endpoint": "/new-feature",
  "method": "POST",
  "request": {
    "parameter1": "description",
    "parameter2": "description"
  },
  "response": {
    "result": "description"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Options**
What configuration options should be available?

```python
config = Config()
config.new_feature.enabled = True
config.new_feature.option1 = "value"
```

## Implementation Considerations

**Breaking Changes**
- [ ] This is a breaking change that affects existing APIs
- [ ] This requires migration documentation
- [ ] This affects the framework schema
- [ ] This requires version bump (major/minor/patch)

## Examples and Mockups

**Code Examples**
Provide concrete examples of how this feature would be used:

```python
# Example 1: Basic usage
from mastery_ai import AssessmentEngine

engine = AssessmentEngine()
result = engine.new_feature(input_data)

# Example 2: Advanced configuration
config = Config()
config.new_feature.advanced_option = True
engine = AssessmentEngine(config)
result = engine.assess_with_new_feature(input_data)
```

**Sample Input/Output**
If applicable, provide sample data:

```json
// Input
{
  "content": "sample content",
  "options": {"new_feature": true}
}

// Expected Output
{
  "score": 85.5,
  "new_feature_result": {...},
  "factors_affected": [...]
}
```
