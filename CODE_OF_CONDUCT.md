# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual

  professional setting

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

* Provide constructive feedback on code and documentation
* Respect the architectural decisions and constraints of the MASTERY-AI Framework
* Support evidence-based discussions about framework factors and weights

### Collaboration Standards

* Be patient with contributors learning the framework architecture
* Help maintain the mathematical precision required for framework scoring
* Respect the comprehensive nature of the 148 atomic factors
* Collaborate constructively on framework enhancements and optimizations

### Quality Standards

* Maintain high standards for code quality and testing
* Follow established conventions for framework factor implementation
* Respect the performance requirements (< 30 second assessments)
* Support the goal of 95%+ test coverage

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

* GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Documentation and wiki contributions
* Community forums and chat channels
* Conference presentations and workshops
* Social media interactions about the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement through:

* GitHub issue reports (for public violations)
* Direct contact with project maintainers
* Email to the project team (when available)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Framework-Specific Enforcement

### Technical Violations

For violations related to framework integrity:

* Deliberately introducing mathematical errors in scoring
* Compromising the 148 atomic factor structure
* Violating performance requirements without justification
* Ignoring established architectural patterns

These may result in immediate temporary restrictions on contributing to core
framework components while maintaining ability to contribute to documentation
and non-critical features.

### Quality Violations

For violations of quality standards:

* Consistently submitting code without tests
* Ignoring code review feedback
* Bypassing CI/CD requirements
* Compromising security standards

These will be addressed through progressive enforcement starting with correction
and education.

## Appeal Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you should notify the project maintainers with a concise description
of your grievance. Appeals will be handled by community leaders who were not
involved in the original enforcement action.

## Recognition and Positive Reinforcement

We believe in recognizing positive contributions to our community:

* Outstanding technical contributions
* Helpful mentoring of new contributors
* Constructive participation in discussions
* Improvements to framework documentation
* Community building efforts

Contributors demonstrating exemplary behavior may be recognized in:

* Project documentation
* Release notes
* Community acknowledgments
* Contributor spotlights
