# /coord — Universal Mission Router

**Arguments Provided**: $ARGUMENTS

Dispatch a mission via THE COORDINATOR. Parse the arguments, validate the mission name, hand off to the coordinator with the right mode. The coordinator (`project/agents/specialists/coordinator.md`) owns the orchestration logic — do not duplicate it here.

## Routing Table

Every executable mission file has a row. The **File** column is the mapping — there is no
name-to-filename heuristic to guess at. A mission that ships without a row here is unreachable:
that was A11-ISS-17, where five installed missions hard-errored on `/coord`, and
`scripts/validate-deployment-coverage.sh` now fails if this table and `project/missions/` disagree.

**Modes**: A = greenfield (long-horizon, full tracking). B1 = surgical (minimal context). B2 = maintenance (moderate context). `evidence-repository.md` loads on demand only — never at start.

**Missions that need something from you before they can finish.** Two rows above stop for a human
rather than running clean end to end, and both stop for input the coordinator cannot invent:

- `connect-mcp` writes placeholder `.env.mcp` entries and needs you to paste real API keys into them.
- `operation-recon` needs a target scope (PR number, branch or component list) **and** a reachable
  URL or running dev server. Without both it has nothing to audit.

**Not in this table**: `project/missions/README.md` and `project/missions/library.md`. They are the
mission catalogue, not runnable missions, which is why `/coord library` is correctly an error.

### Control Commands

- `continue` — Coordinator resumes from project-plan.md until blocked. Runs as a **phase-gated meta-loop** (Sprint 6c): each phase loops delegate→verify until it converges (two clean verify rounds) or spends its per-phase error budget (default 3 cycles), at which point it escalates to you rather than burning forward. Advances only on tool-output evidence; resumes from the last evidence-passed gate, never from scratch.
- `complete phase N` — Mark phase N complete; generate phase-(N+1) context.
- `vision-check` — Verify current work against vision in project-plan.md.

### Standalone (NOT routed via /coord)

`/foundations`, `/architect`, `/bootstrap` — pipeline commands; run independently.

## Mode Override

Prefix with `mode:` when default routing is wrong:

```
/coord mode:maintenance security audit-2026-q2
```

Valid prefixes: `mode:greenfield` (A), `mode:surgical` (B1), `mode:maintenance` (B2). The override applies that mode's loading rules regardless of mission name.

## Dispatch Behaviour

1. **Routine detection** (run first). If the arguments contain cadence keywords (see below), do NOT delegate — print the Routine pointer (below) and stop.
2. Parse first argument. If it starts with `mode:`, consume it; the next arg is the mission name.
3. Validate mission name against the routing table or control-command list.
4. If unknown, print the unknown-mission error (below) and stop. No NLP inference.
5. Load the mission file named in the routing table's **File** column, from `project/missions/`. Do not derive the filename from the mission name: the `mission-` prefix is present on some and absent on others, and guessing is what left five missions unreachable (A11-ISS-17).
6. Hand off to THE COORDINATOR with mission name, mode, and input paths. The coordinator's DYNAMIC CONTEXT LOADING protocol applies the per-mode rules.

## Routine Detection (Mode C — operational work)

Recurring or scheduled work belongs in Claude Code Routines, not `/coord`. Routines run on Anthropic-managed cloud, no local session needed.

**Cadence keywords that trigger Routine detection** (case-insensitive, requires explicit cadence):
- Time keywords: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `hourly`, `nightly`
- Day-of-week patterns: `every Monday`, `every Tuesday`, …, `every weekend`, `every weekday`
- Frequency patterns: `every N hours`, `every N days`, `every N minutes`
- Setup keywords paired with cadence: `schedule`, `set up automatic`, `set up recurring`, `recurring`

**Specific operational phrases** (also trigger):
- `pr review`, `code review on every PR`, `review PRs automatically`
- `nightly QA`, `nightly tests`, `daily smoke test`
- `weekly triage`, `backlog triage`, `triage on Monday`
- `daily report`, `weekly report` (when paired with cadence intent)

**When detected, print this pointer** (don't execute, don't delegate):

```
This looks like recurring/operational work. Claude Code Routines handle this
natively (Anthropic-managed cloud, scheduled, no local session needed).

Closest matching template: project/routines/[NAME].md
  - pr-review.md       → PR-triggered code review
  - nightly-qa.md      → scheduled QA sweep
  - backlog-triage.md  → scheduled backlog review

To set up:
  1. Open claude.ai/code/routines and click "New routine".
  2. Paste the prompt block from project/routines/[NAME].md into the prompt field.
  3. Configure repos, trigger, connectors per the template's setup notes.

To run once now (no schedule), invoke /coord with the appropriate mission and
no cadence keywords. Examples:
  /coord document       (one-time doc pass)
  /coord refactor       (one-time refactor)
```

If no template clearly matches, point to `project/routines/README.md` instead and let the user pick.

**Do NOT** trigger Routine detection for plain mission names without cadence words. `/coord deploy` executes; `/coord set up daily deploys` outputs the Routine pointer.

## Unknown Mission Behaviour

If the mission name does not match, print exactly:

```
Unknown mission: <name>

Valid missions:
  Greenfield (Mode A):    build, mvp, dev-setup, dev-alignment, integrate, migrate,
                          architecture, product-description, operation-genesis
  Surgical (Mode B1):     fix
  Maintenance (Mode B2):  refactor, optimize, document, release, deploy, security,
                          connect-mcp, operation-recon

Control:                  continue, complete phase N, vision-check
Override:                 /coord mode:maintenance <anything>
Standalone (not /coord):  /foundations, /architect, /bootstrap
```

…and stop.

## Interactive Mode

If `/coord` is invoked with no arguments, present the routing table and ask which mission to run. Require an explicit mission name in the next response — do not infer from free text.

## Examples

```
/coord build prd.md
/coord fix bug-report.md
/coord mvp vision.md
/coord mode:maintenance security
/coord continue
```
